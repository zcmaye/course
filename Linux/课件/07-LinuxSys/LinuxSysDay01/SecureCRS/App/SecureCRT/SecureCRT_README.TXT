Product Overview
----------------

SecureCRT protects your passwords, user accounts, and data, combining
rock-solid terminal emulation with the strong encryption, broad
authentication options, and data integrity of the Secure Shell (SSH)
protocol.

SecureCRT provides versatile solutions for business, network manage-
ment, information security, and development tasks, from accessing 
host-based applications and administering servers to securely 
accessing behind-the-firewall network resources like e-mail, files,
and printers.

SecureCRT supports SSH1, SSH2, Telnet, Telnet/SSL, RLogin, Serial,
and TAPI protocols and authentication via password, public key, X.509
certificate, and Kerberos v5 via GSSAPI.  Ciphers include AES, 
AES-CTR, Twofish, Blowfish, 3DES, and RC4.

Choose from a wide range of emulations including VT100, VT102, VT220,
ANSI, SCO ANSI, Wyse 50/60, Xterm, and Linux console -– all with ANSI
color.  Unicode support includes the ability to display character sets
from multiple languages, support for languages with right-to-left
reading order, and a character encoding list that includes
commonly-used encodings as well as all encodings supported by the
local system.

SecureCRT features a multi-session tabbed or tiled interface with 
extensive session management and customization features.  Customi-
zation options include toolbars, menus, keymaps, button bar, and 
login scripts, as well as fonts, cursors, and color schemes. 

Named sessions and firewalls let you create individual configurations
that can be used on a session-specific basis.  Other features include
auto logon, printing, Emacs mode, and SOCKS firewall support.

Powerful scripting capabilities including ActiveX scripting support
for VBScript and other scripting languages on Windows, embedded
Python support, and the script recorder save you valuable time by 
automating routine configuration tasks.  Secure file transfers can be
performed using Zmodem, Xmodem, Ymodem, or Kermit from an SSH1 or SSH2
session.  Upload files easily by dragging and dropping them onto an 
SFTP tab or session window.

Save steps with the close integration of SecureCRT and the SecureFX(R)
file transfer client, which share sessions and settings that let you
run SFTP, FTP, SCP, and FTP/SSL file transfer sessions without
reentering passwords.

SecureCRT includes a 30-day try-before-you-buy evaluation license for
the fully functional application and access to VanDyke Software(R)
technical support.

1. New For SecureCRT 7.1
------------------------

SecureCRT 7.1 brings tiled sessions to Mac and Linux versions, adds 
an option to set up dependent sessions for connecting with jump hosts,
and extends file transfer options with Kermit support.  Productivity 
improvements include the ability to send a button bar command to all 
sessions and to optimize data transfer speed with a new send delay 
option.

Here are some of the new features in SecureCRT 7.1:

Tiling for Mac and Linux

  Session tiling is now available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Sessions 
  can be tiled cascaded to compare the contents of two or more sessions;
  use the chat window to send commands to all sessions and see the
  resulting output.

Dependent session option

  Link a session to an SSH2 session that it depends on, which allows
  connection to a jump host before connecting to other sessions.

Kermit support

  Support for the Kermit protocol provides an additional way to 
  transfer files.

Button bar enhancements

  Press SHIFT+<click> on a button to send a button bar command to all
  connected tabbed or tiled sessions.

New character send delay option

  A character send delay option to wait for a text prompt allows data 
  to be sent as fast as the system can handle, rather than using a 
  fixed time delay.

Support for SHA1 in RSA signatures

  Support for SHA1 in RSA signatures in addition to MD5 allows X.509
  certificates to be used in FIPS mode. (Windows only)

Integration with SecureFX for Mac and Linux

  With the availability of SecureFX for Mac and Linux, integration 
  between SecureCRT and SecureFX on Mac and Linux is now possible.

Please see History.txt in the SecureCRT program group for additional 
information on other changes and bug fixes.
